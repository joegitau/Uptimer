# Uptimer

A barebones Node.js application that keeps track of an application's uptime. 

Developed without any NPM Modules nor Framework, Uptimer puts into use only the core Node.js Modules such as Buffer, FS (file system),
Streams, String Decoder, Crypto, Path, process amongst other modules, to create an API that works in both HTTP and HTTPS.
